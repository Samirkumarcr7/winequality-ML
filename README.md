WINE QUALITY PREDICTION ML PROJECT
This project aims to predict the quality of wines based on various features and characteristics using machine learning techniques.

DATASET
The dataset used in this project is the "Wine Quality" dataset, which contains information about different attributes of wine samples along with quality ratings provided by experts. The dataset includes features such as chemical composition, sensory characteristics, and other relevant factors.

DEPENDENCIES
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed to run the project:
Python (version X.X.X)
Pandas (version X.X.X)
